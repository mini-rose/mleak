mleak
-----

Single header + source library for catching memory leaks, double-frees along
with invalid pointers passed to free & realloc. In order to use this library
you have to compile with -ldl for the dlsym() function.

If you want to disable the library, just define NO_MLEAK with `-DNO_MLEAK=1`.
When something goes wrong mleak will call `exit(1)` to exit the program. To
overwrite this define the _mleak_exit macro.


Example
-------

    #include "mleak.h"

    int main()
    {
        void *p = malloc(24);
    }


Could output:

    Memory leaked, 24 bytes allocated in int main():
    test.c
       4 | {
       5 |     void *p = malloc(24); // => 0x603000000040
       6 | }
